I am a se√±or code arsonist based in Gdansk, PL. Been doing scalable web products, with variety of languages (see above for the most recent), since early 2000s. Constatly working on simplyfing things. I write, talk and ship code. Aside from that I'm el modo evil brujito and a future hoverboard owner.  
You can see my background or resume and contact me on twitter or via email.
