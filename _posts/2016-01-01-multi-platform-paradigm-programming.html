<p>
Polyglot, multi-paradigm environments become the bread and butter of every developer's work. 
With the drive towards microservices and reactive software developers start to look into Erlang/OTP platform more often. 
The platform offers incredible tools we can't directly make use of from within JVM languages or can we?
</p>

<p>
The talk shows the integration between JVM languages and BEAM's LFE/Elixir. 
The fundamental pattern that will be explored are Erlang/OTP as a base platform/language and a JVM-based data access layer.
We will explore JInterface, a set of Java classes which are used to make communication between JVM languages and Erlang, providing a message-based protocol.
To illustrate the concepts and the value coming from running such systems, a distributed cluster is used for demo.
