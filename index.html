    I am a se√±or code arsonist based in Gdansk, PL. Been doing scalable web products, with variety of languages (see above for the most recent), since early 2000s.
    Constatly working on simplyfing things. I write, talk, <a href="{{site.podcast_url}}">podcast</a> and <a href="{{site.github_url}}">ship code</a>.
    Aside from that I'm el modo evil brujito and a future hoverboard owner.
